# Customer-Churn-Prediction

Project Overview
This project predicts which customers are likely to stop using a service using
machine learning classification models. Identifying high-risk customers enables
businesses to take proactive retention measures.

Objective
To predict customer churn based on demographic, service usage, and billing
information.

Dataset
- Telco Customer Churn Dataset (Kaggle)
- Records: ~7,000 customers
- Target Variable: Churn (Yes/No)

Exploratory Data Analysis
- Churn distribution
- Monthly charges vs churn
- Customer tenure analysis

Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Recall
- ROC-AUC Score

Key Insights
- Customers with month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn
- High monthly charges increase churn probability
- Short tenure customers are high risk

Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

Conclusion
The model successfully predicts customer churn and helps identify customers at
risk, enabling businesses to reduce customer loss.
